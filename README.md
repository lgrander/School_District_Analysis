The goal of this challenge was to analyize the standardized testing results from a large number of schools state-wide. The test results covered both Math and Reading from 9th to 12th grade.  The students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. In order to maintain the interety of the analysis the 9th grade data from Thomas High School the data needed to be nulled. The purpose  of this analysis was to determin how removing the dishonest results will effect the results relative to the Module 4 analysis.
